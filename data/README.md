# Overview
## Power analysis
- power_results_final_01: MATLAB object with the components original (absolute power values), fractal (aperiodic components) and oscillatory (relative power values)
- table_power_final_01: contains the absolute and relative delta and beta power, aperiodic offset and exponent, r squared as well as relative alpha and theta values
- number_of_epochs_01: contains number of epochs after the preprocessing

## Connectivity analysis
- table_graph_measures_ROI: contains Small World Index (SWI), thresholds, Clustering Coefficients, Characteristic Path Lengths for delta and beta in their ROI
- table_graph_measures_overall: contains SWI, thresholds, Clustering Coefficients, Characteristic Path Lengths for delta and beta over all electrodes
- table_graph_measures_random: contains SWI, thresholds, Clustering Coefficients, Characteristic Path Lengths for delta and beta in random ROIs
- number_of_epochs_01: contains number of epochs after the preprocessing
